Credit-Score-Classification
Over the years, the company has collected basic bank details and gathered a lot of credit-related information. The management wants to build an intelligent system to segregate the people into credit score brackets to reduce manual efforts.

The Aim:

The objective of this project is to explore the data to identify the pattern that causes the person to become a good or bad or standard type credit score and build a machine learning model that should be able to predict or classify the credit score type.

The procedures were taken to solve the problem:

Understanding the business problem and researching the features and understanding what they exactly are.
Basic checking of the data types and validating the data
Performing a thorough Exploratory Data analysis before modifying(preprocessing) the data.
Inferring the inference found in the EDA step.
Framing the hypothesis on the factors and deriving the conclusions.
Extensive pre-processing for Machine Learning model to build
Building the models from base models to Advanced Ensemble techniques.
Tuning the best-performed model and rebuilding the final model with the best hyperparameter
Business conclusions.
